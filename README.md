### How to Learn with Minemosin?

minemosin is an open source and completely free tool that makes it easy for you to learn key-value based sets, such as foreign language words. It aims to minimize your learning time by testing you and focusing more on your missing points.

* You can create a new set in minemosin or import your sets in files such as excel or csv.
* In the learning mode, you can learn the words you don't know with multiple choice tests. Don't be afraid to make mistakes! minemosin will continue to show you the correct answer until you find out.
* After you complete the tests, minemosin puts you in a quiz where you have to type the answers.
* According to the number of mistakes you make on a word, the priority of the related word increases and minemosin will ask you this word repeatedly from time to time until you are sure that you have learned it.
* This way you can create as many sets as you want, reverse the lists and learn a lot!
